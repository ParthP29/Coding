                The Treaty of Waitangi is an agreement between the British Crown and Māori chiefs that was signed on February 6, 1840 at Waitangi, in the Bay of Islands.
            
            </p>
                 The Treaty is considered New Zealand’s founding document. It was written in Māori and English, but the two versions had different meanings and interpretations1.
                <p>
                The Treaty aimed to protect Māori rights and sovereignty, while allowing British settlement and governance.
